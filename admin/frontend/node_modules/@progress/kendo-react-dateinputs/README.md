The KendoReact Date Inputs offer a highly customizable interface for users to navigate between dates and date ranges, to enter and pick time and date slots, and more. All KendoReact Date Inputs support different locales.

## React Calendar Component

[The KendoReactReact Calendar component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dateinputs/calendar/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dateinputs), part of KendoReact, is a form component representing a Gregorian calendar, allowing users to intuitively select a single date, or date ranges, with a few clicks. The Fast Navigation Bar of the React Calendar provides a shortcut to quickly navigate through years and months without having to leave the context of the main calendar interface of selecting a particular day of the month. The number of the week can be an easy way to discuss upcoming vacations or events.

## React DateInput Component

[The KendoReact DateInput component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dateinputs/dateinput/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dateinputs) is a perfect input component for handling quick and efficient date values. The Spin Buttons of the React DateInput, enabled by a single property, quickly increases or decreases the currently selected portion of the date. The React DateInput supports adding floating labels as part of its input.

## React DatePicker Component

[The KendoReact DatePicker component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dateinputs/datepicker/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dateinputs) is part of KendoReact and offers a highly customizable interface for end users to enter and pick dates supporting different locales. The React DatePicker component supports an input element for manual insertion of a date, the component also features a popup calendar to select dates in a more intuitive and visually pleasing way.

## React Date Range Picker Component

[The KendoReact DateRangePicker component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dateinputs/daterangepicker/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dateinputs) is part of KendoReact and offers a highly customizable interface for end users to select a range of dates spanning over multiple calendars. There may be several cases where a user would need to select the end date first and then select the start date. For this scenario, the React DateRangePicker features built-in logic to autocorrect the selection of its calendars to ensure that the start value is always before the end value.

## React DateTimePicker Component

[The KendoReact DateTimePicker component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dateinputs/datetimepicker/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dateinputs) is part of KendoReact and combines the ability to select both a date and a specific time of day through a highly-customizable component. The React DateTimePicker supports adding floating labels as part of its input. The KendoReact DateTimePicker can handle the full 24-hour clock and can select from any day in the past or the future, which may be too broad of a range for your application.

## React MultiViewCalendar Component

[The KendoReact MultiViewCalendar component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dateinputs/multiviewcalendar/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dateinputs) offers a user interface with multiple calendars side by side to enable end users to select a range of dates spanning over multiple months. With the Multiple Views feature, any number of calendars can be added to the collection of displayed calendars. Thanks to the reverse range selection feature of the React MultiViewCalendar, no matter which order dates are selected, the component will always keep track of the start and end dates.

## React Time Picker Component

[The KendoReact TimePicker component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dateinputs/timepicker/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dateinputs) provides an intuitive interface for entering or selecting any time of day. For scenarios that need to limit the time slots that the KendoReact TimePicker offers to users, there are min and max configuration options to help limit the range of time slots available. The React TimePicker supports adding floating labels as part of its input.
