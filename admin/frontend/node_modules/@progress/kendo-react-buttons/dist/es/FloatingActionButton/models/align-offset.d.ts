/**
 * Specifies the horizontal and vertical offset applied to the Floating Action Button.
 *
 * Normally, the floating button is positioned next to the boundaries of its container with a default offset of `16px`.
 *
 * Positive offsets move floating buttons, which are in a corner, further from that corner. Buttons, which are
 * not in a corner, can be moved along the container's boundary or towards the center of the container.
 *
 * A negative offset can be used to force a button to overflow the boundaries of its container.
