## React Dialog Component

[The KendoReact Dialog component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dialogs/dialog/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dialogs) is part of KendoReact and presents a modal window with content and prompts the user to take specific actions by interacting with built-in buttons for different actions. The React Dialog has the flexibility to define custom actions and buttons at the bottom of the component, referred to as the Dialog Action Buttons. By default, the KendoReact Dialog has some internal calculations for height and width, but these can easily be overridden by using the width and height bindings of the Dialog component.

## React Window Component

[The KendoReact Window component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dialogs/window/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dialogs) displays content in a non-modal fashion and allows for the window to be moved throughout the page as well as resized based on user requirements.Each React Window has built-in action items for minimizing, maximizing and closing the window. By default, the React Window is in an uncontrolled state and can be resized or moved depending on its internal logic. For scenarios that require a controlled component, every aspect of the window can be maintained by controlling the state of the component.
## React Dialogs Library Shared Features

Among the many features which the KendoReact Dialogs deliver are:

* **Modal**&mdash;The dialogs can be shown as modal on the page to prevent the user from interacting with other elements on the page.
* **Resizing**&mdash;You can resize the window to change its dimensions to better view a large content.
* **Dragging**&mdash;The window can be dragged across the page, to position it at a specific part of the page.
* **Keyboard navigation**&mdash;The Dialogs can be controlled by the keyboard.
* **Title and content**&mdash;You have full control over what is rendered in the dialogs title and content.
* [**Theme support**](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/styling/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dialogs)&mdash;The KendoReact Dialogs, as well as all 100+ components in the KendoReact suite, are styled in three polished themes (Bootstrap, Material, and Default) and can be further customized to match your specific design guidelines.
