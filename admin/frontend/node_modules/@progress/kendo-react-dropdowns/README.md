## React AutoComplete Component

[The KendoReact AutoComplete component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dropdowns/autocomplete/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dropdowns) is part of KendoReact and lets your end-users type text into an input element and a list of suggested items will appear in a popup beneath. With suggestions turned on, the React AutoComplete will fill in the input field with suggestions from the underlying data, saving the user a lot of time when selecting data in the AutoComplete.

## React ComboBox Component

[The KendoReact ComboBox component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dropdowns/combobox/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dropdowns) is part of KendoReact and is a form component designed to let end users choose a predefined value from a list, and often is used as a much richer version of the select HTML element. Initially popularized by Material Design, Floating Labels have become so popular that almost any input can take advantage of their sleek look and feel. With the suggestion feature enabled, the KendoReact ComboBox will attempt to autofill the input element based on the closest available value.

## React MultiColumnComboBox Component

[The KendoReact MultiColumnComboBox component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dropdowns/multicolumncombobox/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dropdowns) provides a dropdown component that displays information about items in multiple fields arranged in columns. The KendoReact MultiColumn ComboBox comes with filtering, grouping, virtualization and more handy features. When handling larger sets of data, it is very helpful to organize information in categories. With grouping enabled, the React MultiColumn ComboBox can group all data items by a particular field.

## React DropDown List Component

[The KendoReact DropDownList component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dropdowns/dropdownlist/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dropdowns) is a form component that enables end users to choose a single predefined value from a list, without support for typing in values, and is a richer form of the select element. The KendoReact DropDownList can be bound to various forms of data, including datasets of objects, an array of primitive values or binding directly to a single value property. Additionally, the React DropDown List can bind separate fields to the displayed text and the underlying value. By Default, the KendoReact DropDownList will render an empty area if no value has been displayed. Some requirements may call for some sort of placeholder string indicating what the DropDownList component is for, which is where the default item feature comes in.

## React DropDownTree Component

A combination of a TreeView and a DropDown component, [the KendoReact DropDownTree component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dropdowns/dropdowntree/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dropdowns) is perfect for forms that need to display complex data concisely. When users interact with this simple input element, the dropdown opens up to reveal a built-in TreeView with a hierarchical structure.

## React MultiSelect Component

[The KendoReact MultiSelect component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dropdowns/multiselect/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dropdowns) is a form component that displays a list of options in a popup and allows for multiple items to be selected from this list. Each selected item is rendered as a tag in the input element. With the custom tags feature, the MultiSelect can customize what to display when an item is selected, including having a single tag representing all selected items.

## React MultiSelectTree Component

[The KendoReact MultiSelectTree component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dropdowns/multiselecttree/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-dropdowns) is a form component that lets you choose multiple predefined values from a hierarchical list and is a richer version of the `select` element. The component supports filtering, custom rendering, keyboard navigation, expand and collapse of the `hierarchical` data items.
